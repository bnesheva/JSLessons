    Hello my friend, I hope you doing fine. Pls open your browser console - try F12 - and find there the results of my script about Array Methods homework. Alternatively, you can run the JS file on its own in nodeJS. Wish you a pleasant day! :)

	<p>This is for task 12 - it changes after 2 sec :) - f5 if you missed it</p>
